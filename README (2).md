# The Moonlit Shrine

This game is a short text adventure where the player explores a moonlit forest, finds a rope and a key, lights a torch, and ultimately restores an ancient shrine by placing the Moon Idol on the altar. I chose this theme because I enjoy atmospheric, puzzle-driven adventures where exploration and simple logic lead to victory. The forest-and-shrine setting gave me a chance to include multiple locations, hidden items, and a few challenges (like lighting the torch and building a rope bridge) to make the win feel rewarding.
